# BATTLE

![space battle](images/BATTLE.png)


Player must fight to defend the earth from invading aliens. 

The game opens to the start page. The player has the option to click instructions to see how to play. The player will click start to begin the game. 

The player will be able to move the ship back and forth and shoot at approaching alien ships. Alien ships will shoot back at the player's ship. 

The player must be able to view their own ship's statistics in the panel. They can also see the enemy / target ship's statistics. 

Users should be able to target specific ships by moving below them and shooting them.  

Each level will have a set number of ships. Once the user destroys all the ships, they will proceed to the next level, which will have more, harder-to-kill ships. 

Once the user defeats all of the small ships on earth, they will go to the final level and fight the waves of remaining alien ships in space. 

If the user runs out of hull points before defeating all of the alien ships, the game is over and the user is taken to the game over screen. 

The user will have the option to click start over to reset the game. 




This game was made using jQuery and HTML5 Canvas. 

Future versions of this game will have dynamic alien ships that move and fly towards the user to make the game more fun and challenging. There will be multiple different types of alien ships (some of which have special attacks or defenses). It will also have additional levels in new and exciting locations. There may also be a two-player option.

A problem that I overcame in the process of creating this game was learning how to animate the Canvas in a way that 1. worked and 2. did not crash the browser window once I added in more than one moving piece.
