# BATTLE


Player must fight to defend the earth from invading aliens. 

The player will be able to move the ship back and forth and shoot at approaching alien ships. Alien ships will slowly move forward and shoot back at the player's ship. 

The player must be able to view their own ship's statistics in the panel. They can also see the enemy / target ship's statistics. 

Users should be able to target specific ships. 

Each level will have a set number of ships. Once the user destroys all the ships, they will proceed to the next level, which will have more, harder-to-kill ships. 

Once the user defeats all of the small ships, they will go to the final level and fight the alien MotherShip.
